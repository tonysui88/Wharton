The following topics have information gaps or stale data in our review database:
${gapList}
${requiredSection}
The reviewer just wrote: "${reviewText.slice(0, 500)}"
They already covered these topics: ${coveredTopics.join(", ") || "none"}

Generate exactly 2 short, specific follow-up questions. ${gapInstruction}
Questions must:
- Be conversational and easy to answer
- Reference specific property features where relevant (don't be generic)
- Feel natural, like a friend asking about their stay
- NOT ask about anything the reviewer already mentioned
- NOT repeat any topics they covered
- CRITICAL: Each question must cover ONE thing only, never combine two questions into one with "and" or "?" mid-sentence. If you need to ask about two aspects, pick the most important one.

Choose the question type carefully:
- Use "yes_no" for binary questions: "Did you use the pool?", "Was parking available?", "Did the room have a bathtub?"
- Use "text" with scaleType "quality" for experience ratings: "How was the WiFi speed?", "How was the fitness center?", "How was the breakfast quality?"
- Use "text" with scaleType "agreement" for statement-based questions: "The staff were helpful and responsive", "The location was convenient for getting around"
- Use "multiple_choice" only when a fixed set of options is clearly better than a scale

Respond ONLY with a valid JSON array (no markdown, no extra text):
[{"question": "...", "type": "text|yes_no|multiple_choice", "scaleType": "quality|agreement", "options": ["..."] (only if multiple_choice), "topic": "human-readable topic name", "topicId": "one of: cleanliness|location|food_breakfast|wifi_internet|parking|pool_fitness|checkin_checkout|noise|room_comfort|bathroom|staff_service|value|spa_wellness|accessibility|eco_sustainability", "priority": "high|medium"}]`;
