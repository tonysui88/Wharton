/**
 * lib/ml/topic-classifier.ts
 *
 * Embedding-based topic classifier.
 *
 * Each topic has a rich natural-language description designed to capture its
 * semantic space — not just surface keywords. The incoming review text is
 * embedded and compared (cosine similarity) against each topic description.
 * Topics above the threshold are assigned.
 *
 * This replaces string.includes() keyword matching and handles:
 *  - Paraphrasing  ("lumpy mattress" → Room Comfort, no keyword hit)
 *  - Indirect references ("couldn't sleep" → Noise without the word "noise")
 *  - Negation context is partially handled by the embedding space
